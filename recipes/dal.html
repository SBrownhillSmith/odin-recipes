    <h3>Description</h3>
    Meera Sodha takes this delicious dal to another level topping it with coconut and lime kale. The combination of flavours and textures transform what might be an everyday dish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g/10½oz red lentils</li>
        <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
        <li>8 fresh curry leaves</li>
        <li>1 lemongrass stalk, halved and bashed</li>
        <li>4 cloves</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick, halved</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 large garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>2cm/¾in piece fresh root ginger, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>3 green finger chillies, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>400ml tin coconut milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the lentils, place the lentils in a large bowl and wash them in cold water until the water runs clear. Cover the lentils with 750ml/1¼ pint water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the coconut oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and, when hot, add the curry leaves and lemongrass. When the curry leaves start to crackle, add the cloves and cinnamon. Stir-fry for 1 minute then add the onion. Cook for 10–12 minutes, until the onions are soft enough to cut with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, ginger and chillies. Stir-fry for another couple of minutes, then add the turmeric and salt. Stir again and add the lentils and water to the pan. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat right down and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk and lime juice to the pan and simmer until the lentils are creamy. Cover to keep warm.</li>

    </ol>
